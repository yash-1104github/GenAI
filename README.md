</hr>

**Application Overview:**
 The AI-Image-Generator is a platform that allows users to generate images using AI. By providing a detailed text prompt, users can create images based on their descriptions. The application leverages powerful AI image generation models to transform text into visual art. Additionally, users have the option to share their generated images with the community, helping to foster collaboration and creativity.

**Key Features**
- AI Image Generation:
  - Users can generate images based on custom text prompts.
  - The AI uses natural language processing to interpret the input and generate a relevant image.
- Community Sharing:
  - Users can share their generated images with the community.
  - View and engage with others’ creations, fostering a collaborative environment.
- User-Friendly Interface:
  - Simple, intuitive UI for easy navigation and prompt submission.

**Technology Stack**
- FRONTEND TECH -  HTML, TAILWINDCSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT,  MATERIAL-UI
- BACKEND TECH -  NODE.JS, EXPRESS.JS , RESTful-API
- DATABASE - MONGODB , CLOUDINARY
- DEPLOY - RENDER, VERCEL

**How It Works**
- User Input: Users enter a text prompt describing the desired image (e.g., “a sunset over the ocean with mountains in the background”).
- AI Image Generation: The backend sends the text prompt to an AI model (e.g., OpenAI’s DALL·E or similar) which processes the input and generates an image.
- Image Display: The generated image is displayed to the user on the frontend, allowing them to save or share it.
- Community Feature: After generating the image, users can share it with the community, allowing others to view and comment on it.
